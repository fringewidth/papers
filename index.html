            <p>Academic papers can be a nightmare to read. Even when the topic is fascinating, all the dense jargon,
                endless equations, and walls of text make it feel like research is gatekeeping itself. But here’s the
                thing: strip away the technicalities, and a lot of it is actually pretty easy to understand.</p>
            <p>I’ve always wished researchers would take the time to break down their work for the rest of us. Since I
                can’t change how others write, I figured I’d start with my own. </p>
            <p>This site is my attempt to make my
                research accessible—no complex formulae, no confusing terminology, just the core ideas explained in a
                way that makes sense.</p>

                    <p>How do you share hospital data without revealing their exact locations? We found a way to blur
                        the details while keeping the big picture intact.</p>

                    <p>Big datasets slow down models, but what if we could cut out the fluff without losing important
                        features? This graph-based approach does exactly that.</p>

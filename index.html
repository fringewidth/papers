            <p>Academic papers follow a specific format for good reasons: rigor, reproducibility, peer review.
                But that same format can make fascinating research harder to engage with, especially when you're
                just trying to understand the core ideas.</p>
            <p>I've always appreciated when researchers take the time to share their work in more accessible ways
                alongside the formal publications. So I figured I'd try doing that with my own research.</p>
            <p>This site is where I break down my work into more digestible pieces. Sometimes that's explaining
                the intuition behind an algorithm. Sometimes it's walking through a mathematical proof with more
                context. Sometimes it's highlighting the one insight that makes everything click. Whatever helps
                bridge the gap between a formal paper and understanding the actual ideas.</p>

                        High-dimensional datasets contain natural redundancies. A theorem about transitive correlation
                        explains how to find them.</p>

                    <p>How do you share hospital data without revealing their exact locations? We found a way to blur

                    <p>Big datasets slow down models, but what if we could cut out the fluff without losing important
                        features? This graph-based approach does exactly that.</p>
